## Planetary Simulator

#### Controls:

Move around: W, A, D, S
Zoom in/out: Up/S
Reset Zoom: Left Control
Show trace from planets: Q
Hover over one of the planets on the top left and you will be fixed onto that specific one. Unhovering will undo it. You are allowed to move around even while hovered.

#### Goals
- Planet path predictor based off of a reference.
- Galaxy Builder. An editor to easily create galaxys.

#### Known Problems:
- Trace doesn't "proprely" show when zoomed out.
- Zooming in and out may cause lag due to transformation of the Tracer.
- Tracer may cause 'Out of memory'.
